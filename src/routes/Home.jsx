        I currently work as a nurse in a hospital. Patients requiring education
        about procedures, surgeries, and/or recovery are provided paper
        booklets. Unfortunately the standardized booklet is not accessible for
        all patients. Patients have increasing complex needs that a booklet
        cannot address, as well some patients are illiterate, blind, or
        non-english speaking. This project is a patient education tool to be
        used when onboarding a patientwith their health plan is needed. Editable
        fields allow the educator to change and update any information for
        individualized patient education, allowing us to easily address
        individual and complex needs.
